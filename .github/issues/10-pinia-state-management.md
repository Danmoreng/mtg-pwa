## Description

Refactor the application to use Pinia for centralized state management to improve data flow and component communication.

## Rationale

Pinia provides better organization of state management compared to basic Vue reactivity, making the application more maintainable as it grows.

## Implementation Plan

1. Install Pinia as a dependency
2. Create a store directory structure
3. Migrate existing state management to Pinia stores
4. Update components to use Pinia stores

## Files to Modify

- package.json (add dependency)
- src/app (various files to implement store integration)
- src/features/ (update components to use stores)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Pinia is properly integrated into the application
- [ ] Existing functionality works without changes
- [ ] State is properly managed through Pinia stores
- [ ] Components properly react to state changes
- [ ] Unit tests pass for state management

## Dependencies

This is a future enhancement to be implemented after core milestones are complete
