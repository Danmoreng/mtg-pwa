## Description

Restructure the UI components to be more modular and reusable across different parts of the application.

## Rationale

Reusable components reduce code duplication and improve maintainability. This also makes it easier to implement consistent UI patterns.

## Implementation Plan

1. Analyze existing components for common patterns
2. Create base components for common UI elements (cards, tables, forms)
3. Refactor existing components to use the new base components
4. Create a component documentation/style guide

## Files to Modify

- src/components/
- src/ui/
- Feature-specific component files

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All existing UI renders correctly
- [ ] Common components are reusable across different views
- [ ] Component API is consistent and well-documented
- [ ] Unit tests pass for UI components

## Dependencies

This is a future enhancement to be implemented after core milestones are complete
