## Description

Create ManaBox scans and matching as specified in the project plan:

1. Create `workers/manaboxCsv.ts`

- [ ] Scans are stored in database with fingerprints
- [ ] Matching algorithm correctly links scans to sales
- [ ] Scans view shows sold/owned status
- [ ] Multi-quantity scans are handled correctly
- [ ] Unit tests pass for matching algorithm
