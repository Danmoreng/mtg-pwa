## Description

Add a comprehensive caching mechanism for all Scryfall API requests to handle rate limiting gracefully.

## Rationale

Scryfall has a rate limit of 10 requests/second. A caching layer will:
- Prevent hitting rate limits
- Improve application performance
- Reduce data usage

## Implementation Plan

1. Create a caching service for API requests
2. Implement request queue with rate limiting
3. Add cache expiration and cleanup mechanisms
4. Update ScryfallProvider to use the caching service

## Files to Modify

- src/core/ (new caching service)
- src/features/pricing/ScryfallProvider.ts
- src/data/db.ts (potentially for cache storage)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] API requests are cached appropriately
- [ ] Rate limits are not exceeded
- [ ] Cache expires according to defined policies
- [ ] Application handles rate limiting gracefully
- [ ] Unit tests pass for caching functionality
