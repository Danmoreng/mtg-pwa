# Task 8 Assessment: Ensure mergeLots Exists & Is Correct

## Status: COMPLETED

## Summary
The `mergeLots` function has been implemented and is functioning correctly according to the M3 implementation plan specifications. The implementation properly handles lot merging with the correct business rules.

## Implementation Analysis

### 1. Function Location
The `mergeLots` function is implemented in:
- File: `src/features/scans/ReconcilerService.ts`
- Line: 116-156

### 2. Function Signature
```typescript
export async function mergeLots(targetLotId: string, fromLotId: string): Promise<void>
```

### 3. Implementation Details
The current implementation correctly follows the M3 specification:

1. **Transaction Safety**: Uses `db.transaction('rw', ...)` to ensure atomicity
2. **Identity Validation**: Checks that both lots exist and have matching cardId
3. **Merge Logic**:
   - Sums quantities from both lots
   - Keeps the earliest purchase date
   - Moves all scans from the source lot to the target lot
   - Moves all transactions from the source lot to the target lot
   - Deletes the source lot after migration

### 4. Specification Compliance
Comparing with the M3 Implementation Plan requirements:

✅ **Moves scans & transactions**: Implementation correctly migrates scans and transactions
✅ **Same identity only**: Validates that `fromLot.cardId === targetLot.cardId`  
✅ **Quantity summing**: Correctly sums quantities (`targetLot.quantity + fromLot.quantity`)
✅ **Date handling**: Keeps earliest `purchasedAt` date
✅ **Cleanup**: Deletes source lot after merging

### 5. Export and Accessibility
The function is properly exported from the module and can be imported by other modules.

### 6. Test Coverage
Currently, there are no specific unit tests for the `mergeLots` function. This represents a gap in test coverage that should be addressed.

## Recommendations

1. **Add Unit Tests**: Create tests in `__tests__/` directory to verify:
   - Successful merge of two lots
   - Proper error handling when lots don't exist
   - Correct quantity calculation
   - Proper date handling
   - Scan and transaction migration
   - Source lot deletion

2. **Integration Tests**: Add tests to verify mergeLots works correctly within the broader reconciliation workflow.

## Conclusion
The `mergeLots` implementation exists and is correct according to the M3 specification. The core functionality is properly implemented with appropriate safeguards. The main improvement needed is adding comprehensive test coverage.
