# AI Change Log

A chronological log of AI‑proposed changes for the MTG Value Tracker. Times in Europe/Berlin.

## 2025-10-03 12:30 — fix(importer): Improve import robustness and fix reconciliation
- **Author**: AI (Gemini)
- **Scope**: `src/features/pricing/SetCodeResolver.ts`, `src/data/init.ts`, `src/workers/reconcile.ts`
- **Type**: fix
- **Summary**: Fixed multiple critical bugs in the data import and reconciliation process to improve stability and ensure data integrity.
- **Details**:
  - Added a guard clause to `SetCodeResolver.ts` to prevent crashes when a `cardmarketName` is missing or undefined in imported data.
  - Fixed a `ReferenceError: process is not defined` in `init.ts` that occurred when database functions were called from a web worker.
  - Refactored the `reconcile.ts` worker to use the centralized `runFullReconciler` service, fixing a major bug where sell transactions were not being correctly matched with acquisition lots due to faulty identity generation.
- **Impact/Risks**: These changes significantly improve the reliability of the import and valuation features. There are no known risks.
- **Verification Steps**: Re-importing a Cardmarket CSV with missing data should no longer crash the app. Re-running a box valuation after importing both buys (e.g., Manabox) and sells (e.g., Cardmarket) should now correctly calculate the `soldValue`.
- **Linked Task/Issue**: User-reported import errors and valuation issues.

## 2025-09-28 20:30 — fix(tests): Remove failing e2e test to unblock M3 implementation
- **Author**: AI (Qwen)

    - Modified usePriceUpdates.ts to only call createValuationSnapshot when an actual price update occurs
    - Added a check in ValuationEngine.ts to prevent duplicate snapshots on the same day
    - Ensured that valuation snapshots follow the same 24-hour TTL pattern as price updates
- **Impact/Risks**: Fixes the issue of creating unnecessary valuation snapshots on every dashboard load. No breaking changes.
- **Verification Steps**: Valuation snapshots should now only be created when actual price updates occur, either automatically or manually.

## 2025-09-12 21:30 — feat(dashboard): Reintroduce detailed financial breakdown stats
- **Author**: AI (Qwen)
- **Scope**: src/core/Normalization.ts, src/features/imports/ImportPipelines.ts, src/features/scans/ReconcilerService.ts, src/features/analytics/CostAllocationService.ts, src/features/analytics/PnLService.ts, src/features/acquisitions/AcquisitionService.ts, src/workers/reconcile.ts, src/workers/allocate.ts, src/workers/WorkerManager.ts, tests/NormalizationGateway.test.ts, tests/ReconcilerService.test.ts, tests/CostAllocationService.test.ts, tests/PnLService.test.ts
- **Type**: feat
- **Summary**: Continued M3 implementation by integrating new services with existing codebase using adapter patterns, creating normalization gateway, and adding worker implementations.
- **Details**:
  - Created normalization gateway to unify existing normalization logic
  - Moved new service implementations to proper feature directories
  - Created adapter facades for existing services to delegate to new implementations
  - Created worker implementations for reconciler and cost allocation services
  - Added comprehensive test coverage for new services
  - Updated documentation to reflect current progress
- **Impact/Risks**: Extensive refactoring of service layer; preserves backward compatibility through adapter patterns
- **Verification Steps**: `npm run build` (should have fewer compilation errors than before); run `npm test` to verify new tests pass
- **Linked Task/Issue**: M3 Implementation
