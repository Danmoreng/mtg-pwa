- Added support for multiple allocation methods:
  - Equal per card
  - By market price
  - Manual
  - By rarity
- Implemented weight computation based on allocation method

#### Created `src/features/analytics/CostAllocationService.ts`:
- Moved cost allocation service implementations to proper feature directories

- Added adapter methods that delegate to new implementations
- Preserved existing public API for backward compatibility

### 7. P&L Calculation Service

#### Created `src/services/pnlCalculation.ts`:
- Implemented `getAcquisitionPnL()` for calculating realized and unrealized P&L
- Added interfaces for P&L data structures:
  - `LotPnL` - P&L details per lot
  - `AcquisitionPnL` - Overall P&L for an acquisition

#### Created `src/features/analytics/PnLService.ts`:
- Moved P&L service implementations to proper feature directories
- Integrated with PriceQueryService for market price lookup

### 8. Acquisition Service

#### Created `src/features/acquisitions/AcquisitionService.ts`:
