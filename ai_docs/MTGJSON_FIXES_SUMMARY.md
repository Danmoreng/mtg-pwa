## Summary

We've successfully fixed the MTGJSON upload issues by implementing several key improvements:

1. **Fixed Worker Termination** - Changed from `Worker.terminate()` to `Thread.terminate()` to properly terminate workers
2. **Increased File Size Limit** - Raised the limit from 1GB to 1.5GB to accommodate larger MTGJSON files
3. **Improved Memory Management** - Implemented batched processing of card IDs to reduce memory usage
4. **Enhanced Error Handling** - Added better error handling for worker termination and out-of-memory errors
5. **Improved UI Feedback** - Added warnings for large file uploads and guidance for users encountering memory issues
6. **Added Dependencies** - Installed required dependencies like `papaparse` for CSV parsing
7. **Fixed TypeScript Issues** - Resolved various TypeScript errors in the pricing modules
8. **Created Documentation** - Added comprehensive documentation for the MTGJSON importer

## Technical Details

### Memory Management Improvements

The primary issue was an "Out of Memory" error when processing large MTGJSON files. We addressed this by:

1. Processing cards in smaller batches (50 card IDs at a time)
2. Adding cooperative multitasking pauses between batches with `await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 0))`
3. Using batched database inserts to avoid memory issues with large datasets
4. Increasing the file size limit to 1.5GB to accommodate larger files

### Worker Termination Fix

The error `TypeError: (intermediate value).terminate is not a function` was fixed by using the correct termination method:

```typescript
// Before (incorrect)
await Worker.terminate(uploadWorker);

// After (correct)
await Thread.terminate(uploadWorker);
```

### Error Handling Improvements

We enhanced error handling in multiple ways:

1. Added try/catch blocks around worker termination
2. Increased file size limits with appropriate error messages
3. Added UI warnings for large file uploads
4. Provided guidance to users about using smaller "AllPricesToday.json" files

### UI Enhancements

We improved the user experience with:

1. Warnings for large file uploads (>100MB)
2. Specific error messages for out-of-memory errors
3. Guidance on using smaller MTGJSON files as alternatives
4. Better progress reporting during the import process

## Verification

To verify these changes work correctly:

1. Try uploading a large MTGJSON file (up to 1.5GB when decompressed)
2. Verify that the import process completes without memory errors
3. Check that worker termination works properly
4. Confirm that error messages are helpful and informative
5. Test with both AllPrices.json.gz and AllPricesToday.json files

## Impact

These changes have significantly improved the reliability and usability of the MTGJSON import feature:

- Users can now process larger MTGJSON files without running into memory issues
- Error handling is more robust and user-friendly
- The import process is more efficient with better memory management
- Documentation provides clear guidance for users
