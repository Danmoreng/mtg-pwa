# Milestone 2 Progress Summary - September 13, 2025

## Overview
Today we made significant progress on implementing Milestone 2 features for the MTG Collection Value Tracker. The focus was on refining the pricing architecture to have a single type of price (euro) with different sources rather than multiple providers, as per the product owner's feedback.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Simplified Price Point Architecture
- **Changed from "provider" to "source"**: Updated the PricePoint interface to use `source` instead of `provider` to reflect that all prices are in EUR but come from different sources (Scryfall, MTGJSON, Cardmarket).
- **Simplified source values**: Reduced from complex provider names like 'cardmarket.priceguide' to simple source names like 'cardmarket'.

### 2. Database Schema Updates
- Updated the PricePoint interface in `src/data/db.ts` to use `source` field instead of `provider`
- Modified database indexes to use `source` instead of `provider`
- Updated the migration function to convert existing provider values to source values

### 3. Codebase Refactoring
- Updated `PriceQueryService` to use source precedence instead of provider precedence
- Modified all repository methods to use source instead of provider
- Updated workers (`priceSync.ts`, `mtgjsonBackfill.ts`) to create price points with source instead of provider
- Updated services (`PriceUpdateService`, `PriceGuideSyncWorker`) to use source instead of provider

### 4. UI Updates
- Modified `PriceHistoryChart.vue` to remove provider switching functionality (will be simplified further tomorrow)

## Files Modified
1. `src/data/db.ts` - Updated PricePoint interface and database schema
2. `src/data/repos.ts` - Updated repository methods
3. `src/features/pricing/PriceQueryService.ts` - Updated to use source precedence
4. `src/features/pricing/PriceUpdateService.ts` - Updated price point creation
5. `src/features/pricing/PriceGuideSyncWorker.ts` - Updated price point creation
6. `src/features/analytics/ValuationEngine.ts` - Minor updates
7. `src/workers/priceSync.ts` - Updated price point creation
8. `src/workers/mtgjsonBackfill.ts` - Updated price point creation
9. `src/components/PriceHistoryChart.vue` - UI updates (in progress)

## Next Steps
1. Complete the UI updates in `PriceHistoryChart.vue` to remove provider switching and only show finish options
2. Update tests to reflect the new source-based architecture
3. Verify all functionality works correctly with the simplified model
4. Add documentation updates to reflect the architectural changes

## Key Insight
The product owner clarified that there should only be one type of price (euro) with different sources, rather than multiple providers with switching capabilities. This simplifies the user experience and aligns better with the actual data model where all sources provide euro prices from Cardmarket.
