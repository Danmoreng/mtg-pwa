# MTG Collection Value Tracker - Implementation Summary

## Project Overview

This project implements a client-only Vue 3 + TypeScript PWA for tracking Magic: The Gathering collection value using IndexedDB (Dexie) for storage and plain CSS for styling.

## Features Implemented

### Foundation (Milestone 1 - ✅ Complete)
- Vue 3 + TypeScript project with Vite
- PWA support with vite-plugin-pwa
- ESLint + Prettier configuration
- Strict TypeScript setup
- Base folder structure (app, core, data, features, ui, workers)
- Vue Router with basic layout
- CSS tokens and reset
- Dexie database with typed repositories
- Core domain types and utilities (Money, Settings)
- Basic UI components

### Enhanced Deck Import Functionality (✅ Complete)
- Card image fetching from Scryfall API with proper URL structure
- Progress bar during import to show import status
- Non-blocking processing to prevent UI freezing
- Database constraint error resolution
- Grid layout with card images in deck detail view
- Proper ownership calculation and display

### Data Model
- Complete database schema with all required entities:
  - Cards (with Scryfall ID support)
  - Holdings (card ownership)
  - Transactions (buys/sells)
  - Scans (ManaBox imports)
  - Decks (Moxfield integration)
  - Deck cards
  - Price points
  - Valuations
  - Settings

### Core Services
- Money utility for financial calculations
- Scryfall provider for card pricing and image fetching
- Entity linker for card identification
- Valuation engine for portfolio calculations
- Backup service for data export/import
- Snapshot service for historical tracking
- Settings service for app configuration
- Price update service for automatic price updates

### Import Infrastructure
- Cardmarket CSV parser worker (stub implementation)
- Import service framework
- Basic CSV parsing utilities
- Repository patterns for data access

### Workers
- Cardmarket CSV parser worker (stub implementation)
- Price sync worker (stub implementation)

### State Management
- Pinia implementation for state management
- Stores for cards, holdings, transactions, decks, and settings
- Unified MTG store that combines all individual stores

### Pricing & Caching
- Automatic price updates (every 24 hours)
- Price data saving to database during card imports
- Service worker caching for Scryfall API requests
- Rate limiting for Scryfall API requests
- 24-hour price caching mechanism

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend
- Vue 3 Composition API
- TypeScript for type safety
- Vue Router for navigation
- Plain CSS with utility classes
- No external UI libraries
- Pinia for state management

### Data Layer
- Dexie.js (IndexedDB wrapper)
- Repository pattern for data access
- Entity-based schema design
- Migration support

### Background Processing
- Web Workers for heavy operations
- CSV parsing off the main thread
- Price synchronization in background

### Offline Support
- PWA caching strategies
- Local data persistence
- Service worker implementation
- Automatic price updates with 24-hour intervals

## Folder Structure

```
src/
  app/                # App shell, router, PWA bootstrap
  core/               # Types, utils, error handling
  data/               # Dexie db, repositories, migrations
  features/           # Vertical slices (import, holdings, pricing, decks, analytics)
  ui/                 # Components (plain CSS), tokens.css
  workers/            # Web workers for CSV parsing & pricing sync
```

## Recent Improvements

### Deck Import Enhancements
- **Card Image Display**: Implemented proper card image fetching from Scryfall API using the correct `image_uris.normal` path with fallbacks to `large` and `small` sizes
- **User Experience**: Added progress bar during import and non-blocking processing to prevent UI freezing
- **Data Integrity**: Fixed database constraint errors that occurred during deck import
- **UI Enhancement**: Improved deck detail view with grid layout and card images
- **Ownership Tracking**: Enhanced ownership calculation and display

### Pricing System Enhancements
- **Automatic Price Updates**: Implemented automatic price updates that run when the app starts (if more than 24 hours since last update)
- **Price Data Persistence**: Ensured price data is saved to the database when cards are imported
- **Service Worker Caching**: Added service worker caching for Scryfall API requests to improve performance and reduce API usage
- **Rate Limiting**: Implemented rate limiting for Scryfall API requests to respect API limits
- **24-Hour Caching**: Added 24-hour caching mechanism to reduce redundant API requests
- **Database Integration**: Modified UI components to use price data from the database instead of making API calls

### State Management
- **Pinia Implementation**: Implemented Pinia for state management with stores for cards, holdings, transactions, decks, and settings
- **Unified Store**: Created a unified MTG store that combines all individual stores for easier access

### Technical Improvements
- Optimized image fetching by using data from Scryfall API response instead of making separate calls
- Removed custom image caching in favor of browser caching
- Improved error handling and debugging capabilities

## Next Steps

The foundation is complete and ready for implementing the specific features:

1. Complete Cardmarket import functionality
2. Implement ManaBox scan matching
3. Add Moxfield deck integration
4. Build analytics dashboard
5. Polish PWA features
6. Add comprehensive testing
7. Fix remaining TypeScript/ESLint issues

## Reusability from Legacy Code

The project leverages concepts from the legacy single-page HTML application:
- CSV parsing patterns
- Cardmarket data handling
- Financial calculation approaches
- User interface concepts

The new implementation improves on the legacy version with:
- Modern Vue 3 architecture
- TypeScript type safety
- Proper separation of concerns
- Background processing for large files
- PWA capabilities for offline use
- IndexedDB for better data management
- Modular, testable code structure
- Automatic price updates with caching
- Service worker implementation for offline support
- Pinia state management for better data flow
