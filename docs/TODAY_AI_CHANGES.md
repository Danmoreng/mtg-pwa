- **Author**: AI (Qwen)
- **Scope**: src/features/decks/DeckImportService.ts, src/features/imports/ImportService.ts, src/features/decks/views/DeckImportView.vue, src/data/db.ts, src/data/repos.ts
- **Type**: feat
- **Summary**: Implement comprehensive deduplication system to prevent duplicate card entries when importing from different sources.
- **Details**:
  - Enhanced data model with lot-based tracking to individually track physical cards
  - Implemented deduplication logic for deck imports to link to existing cards instead of creating duplicates
  - Implemented deduplication logic for Cardmarket imports to link transactions to existing lots
  - Fixed variable declaration issues causing runtime errors
  - Added proper currency tracking to card lots
  - Ensured all required fields are properly populated
  - Improved transaction tracking with better lot linking
  - Fixed numerous TypeScript compilation errors
  - Resolved variable scoping issues
  - Corrected type compatibility problems
- **Impact/Risks**: Significantly improves data integrity by preventing duplicate card entries. Maintains accurate cost basis and valuation tracking. No destructive changes to existing data.
- **Verification Steps**: `npm run build` completes successfully. Import decks and Cardmarket transactions and verify cards are properly linked rather than duplicated.
