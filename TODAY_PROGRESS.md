# Today's Progress: Booster Box Analysis View & Import Reconciliation

This document summarizes the work done today, the issues encountered, and the solutions implemented.

## 1. Initial Goal: Booster Box Analysis View

The primary goal was to create a new view to analyze the value of purchased booster boxes. The view needed to display:
- The original price of the box.
- The aggregated value of cards from the box that have been sold.
- The current market value of the unsold cards from the box.
- The total current market value of all cards that came in the box.

## 2. Implementation Steps

To achieve this, the following components were created:

1.  **`src/features/analytics/BoxValuationService.ts`**: A service to encapsulate the logic for calculating the different value metrics for a given booster box.
2.  **`src/features/dashboard/BoosterBoxesView.vue`**: A new Vue component to display the list of booster boxes and the detailed valuation for a selected box.
3.  **Routing and Navigation**: A new route was added in `src/app/router.ts` and a link was added to the main navigation in `src/components/Navigation.vue` to make the new view accessible.

## 3. Issues Encountered & Debugging

During testing, several issues were identified, primarily related to data integrity and the import process.

### Issue 1: `soldValue` Incorrectly Calculated

The user reported that the `soldValue` was always zero, even when sell transactions for cards from a box existed.

-   **Initial Investigation**: The `BoxValuationService` was initially using `salePriceCent` from the `CardLot` object. It was discovered that this field was not being populated and that the correct source of truth for sales is the `transactions` table.
-   **Fix**: The service was updated to calculate `soldValue` by summing up `unitPrice` from `SELL` transactions linked to the `CardLot`s of the box.

### Issue 2: Transactions Not Linked to Card Lots

The user then reported that even after the service logic was fixed, the `soldValue` was still zero. This led to a deeper investigation into the import process.

-   **Debugging**: `console.log` statements were added to the `BoxValuationService` to inspect the data being processed. This helped to confirm that no `SELL` transactions were being found for the lots of the selected box.
-   **Root Cause Analysis**: The user correctly suspected that the `lotId` on `Transaction` objects was often `null`. This meant the link between a sale and the inventory item was missing.

### Issue 3: Card Count vs. Card Lot Count Mismatch

The user provided a key insight: the total number of `Card`s in the database was higher than the total number of `CardLot`s. This should not happen, as every card that is part of the user's collection (i.e., has been bought or sold) should belong to a lot.

-   **Diagnosis**: This pointed to a flaw in the import process for Cardmarket `SELL` transactions. When a user sold a card that wasn't previously in their database (from a purchase or scan import), the import process would create a `Card` record for it, but not a corresponding `CardLot`.

## 4. Reconciliation and Import Fixes

The investigation revealed that the core issue was that the data reconciliation process was not being run correctly or at all after imports, and the import logic itself had gaps.

1.  **Triggering Reconciliation**: It was discovered that the `ReconcilerService`, which is responsible for linking transactions to lots, was not being called after import operations. 
    -   **Fix**: The `importCardmarketArticles`, `importManaboxScansWithBoxCost`, and `importCardmarketSells` functions were modified to trigger the reconciliation worker (`reconcile.ts`) after they complete.

2.  **Fixing the Reconciler**: A bug was found in the `runFullReconciler` function within the `ReconcilerService`. It was not correctly identifying the unique card identities (card, finish, language) to be processed.
    -   **Fix**: The function was rewritten to correctly gather all unique card identities from the `scans` and `transactions` tables before running the reconciliation for each one.

3.  **Ensuring Card Lot Creation for Sells**: To fix the card/lot count mismatch, the import logic for Cardmarket articles was updated.
    -   **Fix**: In `ImportService.ts`, the `importCardmarketArticles` method was modified. Now, when processing a `SELL` article, if no `CardLot` exists for that card, a new *provisional* `CardLot` is created immediately. 

4.  **Linking Transactions at Creation**: The final issue was that even when a provisional lot was created, the sell transaction was not being immediately linked to it. 
    -   **Fix**: The logic was further refined to pass the ID of the newly created provisional lot to the `createTransactionForArticle` function, ensuring the `lotId` is set on the transaction from the start.

These changes should ensure that the data integrity is maintained during imports and that the booster box analysis view functions as intended.
