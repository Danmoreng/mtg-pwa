Short answer: functionally yes (behind a flag), but a few “last-mile” items remain before you flip the flag for everyone. You can merge the branch safely if you keep `M3_RECONCILER_ONLY` off by default and follow the migration/backfill steps below.

# What’s done

* **Schema v9 in code** (adds `acquisitions`, lot-centric inventory, finish/lang on scans & transactions, composite PK for `deck_cards`, `scan_sale_links`, etc.).
* **Reconciler is implemented** (scans→lots, SELLs→lots, consolidation, provisional lots, merge lots), with tests.
* **Cost allocation service** in place with sum-preserving rounding and multiple methods.
* **P&L (realized & unrealized)** wired to price service.
* **Feature-flagged rollout path**: legacy matcher runs by default; toggling `M3_RECONCILER_ONLY=true` switches to the new reconciler. Tests cover the flag behavior.
* **Backfill/migration utilities exist** (one-time reconciling/backfill and lot financial field updater).

# What’s still outstanding (before enabling M3 for everyone)

1. **Deterministic rounding (Largest Remainder) finish-line polish** – marked “nearly complete” in the status doc. (Current code already does sum-preserving rounding.)
2. **Concurrency/observability hardening** – in-memory lock is present, but a cross-tab/process mutex & richer logs/metrics are still called out as in progress.
3. **E2E flow test** – listed as not complete yet.
4. **Rollout plan & cleanup docs** – explicit rollout doc + legacy removal are listed as “in progress”.

# Data migration gotchas you shouldn’t ignore

* The branch **changes schema/PKs** (e.g., `deck_cards` → composite `[deckId+cardId]`), which **requires a Dexie migration**. The changelog itself flags this as a migration risk.
* Current app bootstrap will **delete the whole DB on an UpgradeError** to work around Dexie’s “can’t change primary key” limitation—fine for dev, risky for real data. Replace with an explicit export-migrate-import or a copy-to-new-store migration before turning M3 on for users.

# Can you merge the branch now?

**Yes — merge behind the flag.** The codebase builds, the reconciler/alloc/P&L are implemented, and the flag keeps legacy paths in place. The status doc itself says it’s “ready for staged rollout,” pending business validation.

# Recommended merge checklist

1. **Keep flag OFF post-merge** (`M3_RECONCILER_ONLY=false`) until migration/backfill is done. (Flag design documented & tested.)
2. **Run migrations/backfill on your data**

    * Backfill identities & reconciliation:
      `ts-node scripts/backfill-m3.ts` (iterates identities and runs `runReconciler`).
    * If you have existing lots, run the **financial fields** updater.
    * Do **not** rely on the “delete DB on upgrade” fallback in `src/main.ts` for production data. Plan a proper Dexie migration/export-import instead.
3. **Verify tests & build locally** (`typecheck`, `build`, unit/integration tests). The status docs expect these to pass.
4. **Smoke test behind the flag**: enable `M3_RECONCILER_ONLY=true` in a staging profile; import scans, sells, run allocation; verify per-box P&L and idempotent re-imports meet the M3 acceptance bullets.
5. **Close the gaps** (quick wins):

    * Finish **Largest Remainder** rounding variant.
    * Add a **BroadcastChannel** or similar cross-tab lock (the plan suggests it explicitly).
    * Add one **Playwright** E2E “happy path” test for import→reconcile→allocate→P&L.
    * Draft a short **rollout/rollback note** (flag on/off, known issues).

# Direct answers

* **Is M3 completed?** Functionally **yes** for core features; officially **“largely implemented with minor refinements in progress.”**
* **Did we forget anything?** The **cross-tab concurrency lock**, **E2E test**, **formal migration (avoid destructive delete)**, and the final **rounding method** pass still need attention per your own docs.
* **Can the branch be merged?** **Yes,** merge now **behind the flag** and execute the migration/backfill plan before enabling for users.

If you want, I can draft the migration steps (export→create new stores→copy→verify) and a one-pager rollout plan you can paste into `ai_docs/`.
